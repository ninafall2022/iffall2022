    <p class="location"> Coral reefs form some of the world's most productive ecosystems, providing complex and varied marine habitats
         that support a wide range of other organisms.Fringing reefs just below low tide level have a mutually beneficial relationship 
         with mangrove forests at high tide level and sea grass meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from 
         strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and sea 
         grass protect the coral from large influxes of silt, fresh water and pollutants. This level of variety in the environment benefits
          many coral reef animals, which, for example, may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.</p>

          <p > Reefs are home to a variety of animals, including fish, seabirds, sponges, cnidarians (which includes some types of corals 
            and jellyfish), worms, crustaceans (including shrimp, cleaner shrimp, spiny lobsters and crabs), mollusks (including cephalopods), 
            echinoderms (including starfish, sea urchins and sea cucumbers), sea squirts, sea turtles and sea snakes. Aside from humans, mammals 
            are rare on coral reefs, with visiting cetaceans such as dolphins the main exception. A few species feed directly on corals,
             while others graze on algae on the reef. Reef biomass is positively related to species diversity.</p>
   
             <p > 
                The same hideouts in a reef may be regularly inhabited by different species at 
                different times of day. Nighttime predators such as cardinalfish and squirrelfish hide 
                during the day, while damselfish, surgeonfish, triggerfish, wrasses and parrotfish hide from eels and sharks.
                
                The great number and diversity of hiding places in coral reefs, i.e. 
                refuges, are the most important factor causing the great diversity and high biomass of the organisms in coral reefs.</p>
