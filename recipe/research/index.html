        <h5>Insturctions</h5>
        <h3>Time: 2 Hours</h3>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Wash and cut the beef brisket into 3 cm square pieces and soak them in water for one hour. Take out the soaked beef and put it into a pot, add cool water to cover the beef. Turn on the heat until the water boils, remove the froth, fish out the beef, wash it with warm water, control and set aside.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Heat oil in another pot until 7 minutes hot, then pour in beef, put soy sauce and cooking wine and stir-fry, add onion and ginger and stir-fry for a while. Then add boiling water without beef, put the spices into the spice box and put it into the pot. Pour the boiling beef with soup into the pressure cooker and cook for 40 minutes with the meat cooking gear.</p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>After the meat is cooked, take three tomatoes and peel them. Cut them into large hobnail pieces and cut the onion into pieces. Put a little oil in a pan and stir-fry the tomatoes and onion cubes. Stir-fry until the tomatoes are sandy, add the tomato paste and stir-fry.</p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Pour the meat and stock from the pressure cooker into the pot of sautéed tomatoes, remove the onion, ginger and spices. Season with salt and sugar and simmer for 30 minutes. Simmer until the tomatoes are mostly melted and the beef is tender. Heat the stone pot, serve the stewed brisket in the stone pot and enjoy.</p>
